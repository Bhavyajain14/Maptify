# Maptify

**Maptify** is an interactive web application that displays a map with points of interest and allows users to interact with the map. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) mapping library (or Google Maps API) for map integration. The project demonstrates key front-end development concepts and offers practical experience with interactive maps.
